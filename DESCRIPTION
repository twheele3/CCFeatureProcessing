Title: Data processing for Cell Counter marker files
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Tim Wheeler
Maintainer: Tim Wheeler <twheele3@uoregon.edu>
Description: This package processes files generated by the Fiji/ImageJ plugin Cell Counter. 
    These files contain cell vector data with expression markers, and this is processed into
    coexpression tables. Cells can be further grouped into features (by default, intestinal crypts).
    These can then be analyzed for expression relative to sample, feature, position, or even adjacent
    cells within features.
